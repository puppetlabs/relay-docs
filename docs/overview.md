# Welcome to Relay by Puppet

Relay helps you automate your applications and infrastructure using simple workflows.

If you're using Relay for the first time, follow our guided [Getting Started](getting_started.md) tour to familiarize yourself with the concepts and learn your way around the tool.

To start authoring your own Relay workflows, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you've got an activated account and can [log in to the Relay service](https://nebula.puppet.com)
2. Install the [Relay command line interface](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay#installation)
3. [Set up your editor](setting-up-editor.md) for Relay authoring. This is optional but makes editing workflows lots easier!
4. [Pick a reference workflow](reference-workflows.md) to use a starting point.
5. Modify it to your heart's desire, then [run it on the service](using-workflows/running-a-workflow.md)

If you're looking for reference material on workflows and steps, we've got you covered:

* [Curated step containers](step-specifications.md)
* [Relay types](reference/relay-types.md)
* [Relay functions](reference/relay-functions.md)

If you get stuck or need help, we're here for you. You can:

* Log on to the [Puppet Community Slack instance](https://slack.puppet.com) and join the developers and community in #relay
* File a Github issue in the [@puppetlabs/relay](https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay/issues/new/choose) repository.
